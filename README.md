### Quantum Wave Function Visualization
This repository contains a simple JavaScript implementation for visualizing quantum wave functions. It uses the Three.js library to render the wave function as a dynamic, 3D line in a WebGL context.

The visualization simulates a basic one-dimensional wave function, which is a solution to the free-particle time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation in one dimension, demonstrating the wave-like nature of quantum particles. The real part of the wave function is plotted, showing its oscillations in a cosine-like pattern.
